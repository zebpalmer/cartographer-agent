# cartographer-agent

Cartographer-Agent is a lightweight system inventory tool written in Go. It runs on your servers to collect various system information and reports them to a centralized server via REST api. Cartographer-Agent helps you maintain a real-time map of your infrastructure.

This project has been around for on my private repo for a few years, in use by a few people. The server isn't open source (yet), but this will post to any REST api so it'd be easy to use the data in your systems. 

> NOTE: This repository is a fresh snapshot of the project, created to keep the original private repositoryâ€™s history separate. (I didn't feel like cleaning up the history on the old repo...)
